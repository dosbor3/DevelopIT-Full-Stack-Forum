# DevelopIT Full Stack Forum

Making the decision to return to school to enhance your skill set is a challenge within itself!  To choose a curriculum such as Full Stack Developer is even more challenging!  When asking for help, current students, and alumni may want to bypass various developer topics that don't relate to the query response they are in search of.  DevelopIT Full Stack Forum provides users with the opportunity to have a more refined search by specifying topics that the users can input and receive assistance from a full stack developer community comprised of current and former students.

DevelopIT Full Stack Forum is a CMS-style blog site, where current and prospective developers can publish their inquries and respond on other developers' inquries as well.
